I used Selenium Webdriver in Java for this exercise and the IDE used was Eclipse.
I used a combination of approaches to write the steps:

- Manual coding
- Recorded code from Katalon IDE (Chrome extension)
- Code snippets from online sources

The tests required were:

1. Create a new account 
2. Login 
3. Find the most expensive dress and add it to the cart 
4. Log out and back in again, ensuring the dress is still in the cart 

I started the exercise with a simple email generator to ensure that once the account was created,
the email could be used for all the tests.
This was very handy when building the single script to avoid log-in errors.

I created a main method to drive the order of the tests. This also allowed me to produce a runnable jar file for a one command test run.
The tests are in different methods, although I combined test 1 and 2 into its own.
Each test has an Assert clause to check the result. This results is sent to the output on screen for review with a brief explanation of the fail.
From running the tests, test 4 failed as the dress was not retained in the cart after log-out and log-in.
The output is displayed in the CMD window along with the date/time of the test run.

To run the test, type the following in the CMD window:

java -jar Parvez_HMRC.jar

NOTE: A video screen grab is provided to see it working.
